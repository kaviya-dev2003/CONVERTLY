# Implementation Plan - CONVERTLY

Build a premium, conversion-focused website platform with a light creamy aesthetic.

## Proposed Changes

### Backend (Express + MySQL)
- **Database Schema**:
  - `users`: id, name, email, password, role (admin, staff)
  - `leads`: id, name, email, business_type, message, status (new, contacted, closed), created_at
- **Routes**:
  - `POST /api/auth/login`: Authentication
  - `POST /api/leads`: Create a new lead from contact form
  - `GET /api/admin/leads`: List all leads (Auth required)
  - `GET /api/admin/stats`: Summary stats for dashboard

### Frontend (React + Bootstrap 5)
- **Design System**: Custom CSS for "Premium Cream Style".
  - Background: `#FAF9F6`
  - Accent: `#4F46E5`
- **Component Library**:
  - Layout: Navbar, Footer
  - UI: Premium Cards, Buttons with micro-interactions, Forms with focus states.
- **Pages**:
  - `Home`: Sections for Hero, Trust, Problem/Solution, etc.
  - `Services`: Visual grid of services.
  - `Case Studies`: Metric-driven client stories.
  - `Contact`: Minimal lead capture form.
  - `Dashboard`: Admin/Staff portal for lead tracking.

## Technical Details
- **Auth**: JWT stored in cookies or localStorage.
- **Styling**: Bootstrap 5 for grid/layout + Scoped CSS for premium visuals.
- **Icons**: React Icons (Lucide or Heroicons style).

## Verification Plan
### Automated Tests
- Simple endpoint testing using `curl` or `postman` logic.
- React component rendering checks.

### Manual Verification
- Test lead submission in the contact form.
- Verify dashboard updates stats in real-time.
- Check mobile responsiveness on various viewport sizes.
